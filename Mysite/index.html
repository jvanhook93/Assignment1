    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>James Van Hook</strong>, I am a 29 year old marine that retired in 2014. I graduated from the <i>University of Southern Mississippi</i> with a <b>bachelors degree</b> in Marine Biology. I decided that after a few years of working offshore that I want to be home more and I have worked a little with coding before and have always had an interest in it. I recently got the opportunity to be able to return to school and decided that I wanted to do a coding bootcamp instead of commiting another 4 years for another bachelors degree. I plan on starting a career as a <ins>software engineer</ins> after graduating from this coarse.</p>
